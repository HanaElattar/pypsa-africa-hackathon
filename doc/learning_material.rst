Depending on what work package you want to contribute you require different skillsets. 
Below we list a set of useful material to prepare for contributions.
Most parts are marked as *essential* and are highly likely to be relevant in most work packages.

If you learn these bits below, you are 100% ready. 
Though, you might learn much more beyond these points. 
Enjoy the journey :)

Preparing for contributions
============================


.. _data_science_basics:

Data science basics (essential)
--------------------------------


- Refresh your Python knowledge by watching `CSDojo's playlist <https://www.youtube.com/c/CSDojo/playlists>`_. His content is excellent as introduction. You will learn in effective short videos the python basics such as variables If/else statements, functions, lists, for loops, while loops, dictionaries, classes and objects, boolean, list comprehensions, sets - put your hands on and write some test scripts as the video suggests. (~3h)
- Familiarize yourself with numpy and panda dataframes.  In the Python-based PyPSA tool, we do not work with Excel. Powerful panda dataframes are our friends. `Here <https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis>`__ is an extensive 30h course that provides a great introduction if this is completely unfamiliar to you.


PyPSA Introduction (essential)
-------------------------------

- Watch how PyPSA-Eur is designed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty47YU1_eeQ (1h)
- Watch and put your hands on to make PyPSA-Eur work on your computer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAwhQnNRIvs (1-3h)
- While watching these PyPSA videos always have a look into the excellent `PyPSA-Eur documentation <https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
- To see what data we can extract we work usually closely with the `basic PyPSA documentation <https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html>`_ 


Git and GitHub (essential)
---------------------------

For code collaboration we use GitHub. Which is a common source control tool that is a very popular collaborative code development tool. Here some notes if you are not already familar with it:

- Git and GitHub is not the same. Usually, you work with git on your computer (offline) to push changes to GitHub (online).
- `Here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE>`__ a great intro which we recommend
- Learning by doing. Maybe one of the best ways to learn is to puts your hands on open a GitHub repository and upload/change/reverse files from your local computer on some dummy scripts.
- This `cheatsheet <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet>`_ might help using the Git commands


Snakemake and advanced changes (essential)
-------------------------------------------

Snakemake is our brain in PyPSA. 
It automates many tasks & keeps the code structure clean. 
Therefore, it is quite useful to learn if your task is to integrate features into PyPSA.
We can recommend: 

- `snakemake basic and advanced tutorial here <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/tutorial.html>`__ (takes max 3-5h and makes a lot of fun).
- Explore how PyPSA uses snakemake in the Snakefile and scripts - the GitHub search function is your best friend to find quickly what interests you.


Code environment (optional)
-----------------------------

We can recommend setting up VScode from Microsoft. Add some extension if you like as described in `this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fROnrISdZU>`_. For instance GitHub, Gitlense, and maybe some others.
