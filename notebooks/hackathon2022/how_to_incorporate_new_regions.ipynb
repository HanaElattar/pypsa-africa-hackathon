    "\n",
    "The current input files have been tested on the African countries, thus, for other regions appropriate input data may be missing and may be added or replaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, in the current workflow some input files needed are automatically downloaded from the original sources by countries according to the list of countries provided by the keyword `countries` in the file `config.yaml`. Some examples are the osm data, downloaded by the rule `download_osm_data` or the GADM shapes, by the rule `build_shapes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other data, instead, cannot be automatically downloaded from the original source, instead, we prepared a databundle (zip files) that are automatically downloaded from google drive. **However, this databundle has been tested for Africa and may be incomplete for other regions**. The input data contained in these files are those where attention should be put when the user is interested into investigating different regions\n",
    "\n",
    "The input data that shall be investigate are contained in the folders `data/raw`, `resources` and `cutouts`. In particular, we provide below some comments about what are the files that shall be investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we add comments about each folder and the files that shall be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Folder `data/raw`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data/raw/hydrobasins`: in this folder the data about the shapes of watershed boundaries and basins are provided, but the current file in the databundle is Africa-specific. Data for other regions are available from [HydroBASINS](https://www.hydrosheds.org/page/hydrobasins). These data shall be calibrated when hydro resource is used.\n",
    "- `data/raw/landcover`: data for Africa-only have been downloaded to reduce the needed space; these files shall be changed according to the areas of interest. Data downloaded from the following [link](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa?tab=WDPA)\n",
    "\n",
    "**No changes expected**\n",
    "- `data/raw/copernicus`: data with global extension\n",
    "- `data/raw/eez`: global marittime data already loaded\n",
    "- `data/raw/gadm`: data downloaded with global scope from build_shapes rule\n",
    "- `data/raw/GDP`: data already with global scope\n",
    "- `data/raw/gebco`: data already with global scope\n",
    "- `data/raw/worldpop`: data automatically downloaded from build_shapes rule\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Folder `resources`\n",
    "\n",
    "The resources folder contains main inputs for the resource and load estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "No changes are expected; except for the demand data, all the other files are generated automatically by the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4. Folder `cutouts`\n",
    "\n",
    "The folder `cutouts` contains the cutouts files that contains timeseries of the renewable production for the region of interest, which are generated using [Atlite](https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite).\n",
    "Currently, you can find a pre-compiled file already built for Africa, for simplicity; however, if a different region shall be investigated, then the file has to be generated for the specific region.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, it is possible to use the rule `build_cutout` that is generally disabled for simplicity, which automatically generates the cutout for the selected regions by usign Atlite. To enable it, you shall go into the `config.yaml` file and change the corresponding boolean value in the `enable` section\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "enable:\n",
    "  build_cutout: true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that, in order to use build_cutout, it is needed to have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- installed the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu) `cdsapi` package  (`install with pip`) and\n",
    "- registered and setup your CDS API key as described [on their website](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to);\n",
    "  the CDS API allows an automatic filedownload by executing this script\n",
    "\n",
    "**Once the build_cutout has been executed, we recommend to disable it, once the files have been generated.** Be aware that the cutouts file are very large."
